        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rosti originated from Switzerland and it is made with shredded potatoes that are pan fried with butter in a skillet until crispy.</p>

        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 to 4 medium starchy potatoes (russets or )</li>
            <li>4-5 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate the raw potatoes using a standard box grater (if you prefer mushy potatoes, parboil the potatoes before grating)</li>
            <li>Squeeze out the excess liquid then transfer to a bowl (no need to be thorough; 2-3 squeezes suffice</li>
            <li>Mix the potato with nutmet, pepper, paprika in the bowl</li>
            <li>Mix 3-4 tbsp butter in an 8-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet and then add in the onion</li>
            <li>Add the grated potatoes about 1 inch deep and salt them as desired</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes over medium heat several minutes (about 5 minutes), 
                stirring two or three times with a metal spatula to coat the potatoes evenly with butter</li>
            <li>Pat the potatoes into a cake with the spatula and let them cook for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Cover the potatoes and cook for another 7 minutes</li>
            <li>When the bottom of the potato cake is golden brown, 
                place a plate that barely fits inside the skillet on top of the potatoes and invert the pan, holding on to the plate</li>
            <li>Remove the pan and set it back on the stove; Add the remaining butter to the pan, allowing it to melt</li>
            <li>Slide the rosti off the plate and back into the pan, golden side up</li>
            <li>Cook for about 15 minutes, pressing down once or twice with the spatula to make the pancake stick together a little more</li>
            <li>You can cover the pan to get the potatoes cooked in the middle if desired 
                but remove the cover at least 5 minutes before the end of cooking so that your pancake is crispy on the outside</li>
            <li>Slice the rosti up or plate as a whole</li>
        </ol>
