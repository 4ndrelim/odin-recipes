        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

        <h4>Hollandaise Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup firm butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Eggs Benedict</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 English muffins</li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tsp butter</li>
            <li>6 thin slices Canadian-style bacon or fully cooked ham</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>4 tsp distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>Paprika and parsley is desired</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In 1-quart saucepan, vigorously stir egg yolks and lemon juice with wire whisk. 
                Add 1/4 cup of the butter. Heat over very low heat, stirring constantly with wire whisk, until butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1/4 cup butter. Continue stirring vigorously until butter is melted and sauce is thickened. 
                (Ensure the butter melts slowly so eggs have time to cook and thicken the sauce without curdling.) 
                If the sauce curdles, add about 1 tablespoon boiling water and beat vigorously with wire whisk or egg beater until smooth. Keep warm.</li>
            <li>Split English muffins; toast the muffins. Spread each muffin half with some of the 3 tablespoons butter; keep warm.</li>
            <li>In 10-inch skillet, melt 1 teaspoon butter over medium heat. Cook bacon in butter until light brown on both sides; keep warm.</li>
            <li>Fill pot with water and add the vinegar. Heat to boiling; reduce to simmering.</li>
            <li>Break cold eggs, one at a time, into custard cup or saucer. 
                Carefully slip eggs into water. Cook 3 to 5 minutes or until whites and yolks are firm, not runny 
                (water should be gently simmering and not boiling). Remove with slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Place 1 slice bacon on each muffin half. Top with egg. Spoon warm sauce over eggs. Sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        </ol>
